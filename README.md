# Degen-Coin-Flip

Simple gambling game where bettors are able to bet on heads/tails and double their money. With the chances of the coin flip being 50/50, the house will take a fee of 2% on all bets regardless of the outcome.

# Notes

Would like to add an Oracle service to provide random number generation instead of using block difficulty and timestamp.
